# Skin Ailment Prediction

This project is a web application that utilizes a machine learning model to predict skin ailments from user-uploaded images. The model provides a list of potential conditions with corresponding probabilities, and a visual "Prediction Highlight" to show which part of the image was most influential in the decision.

## üöÄ Features

*   **Image Upload:** Easily upload an image of a skin condition.
*   **AI-Powered Prediction:** A deep learning model analyzes the image to predict potential skin ailments.
*   **Prediction Highlight:** A visual heatmap indicates the area of the image that the model focused on for its prediction.
*   **Detailed Results:** The top predictions are displayed with their confidence scores and brief descriptions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  **Upload:** The user selects and uploads an image through the web interface.
2.  **Analysis:** The uploaded image is processed and passed to a trained deep learning model on the backend.
3.  **Prediction:** The model identifies and predicts potential skin conditions based on its training.
4.  **Display Results:** The application presents the top three predictions, including the condition name, confidence percentage, and a concise description.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **Backend:** Python with a web framework like Flask or Django.
*   **Machine Learning:** A deep learning framework such as TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch.
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface.
